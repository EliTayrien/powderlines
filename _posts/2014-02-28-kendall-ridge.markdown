The southwestern flanks of Kendall Mountain offer an excellent varierty of options for touring. You can find everything from short, powder lined tree routes with gentler terrain to steep open slide paths here.

####Kendall Ridge####

This tour starts further south by Summit East at the Gold Creek Sno Park. Follow an old logging road for 4 miles to a clear open viewpoint close to the Kendall Lakes basins.

####Kendall Trees or Kendall Knob####

Park near Summit West or off Yellowstone Road and tour up through the trees to the top of the first Kendall Knob. Return the way you came, snaking through the trees. This tour is about 4 miles long and is a popular dawn patrol tour.

####Kendall Peak####

For a more committing adventure, tour farther up Kendall Peak in search of steep and varied terrain. The views aren't bad either!
