Mount Rainier will take your breath away no matter the season. But, in winter it becomes one giant playground.

There are a huge variety of backcountry skiing and snowboarding opportunities from Paradise. For a very low-key day you can skin up to Glacier Vista and ski back. This is a good option if you're out with a large group that might include some snowshoers as well. Soak up the amazing views on a bluebird day and watch out for the crowds of people enjoying the winter wonderland.

For the more adventurous boot up to Panaroma Point and continue onwards to Camp Muir. Their are a number of descent options from glacier descents down steep chutes to following your uptrack back the way you came.

Check out the routes below for GPS tracks of tour options.
